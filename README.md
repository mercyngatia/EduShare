✅ Next steps for you:
1. Create a folder called `screenshots/` inside your project.  
2. Add PNG/JPG screenshots of your site (home page, donation form, etc.).  
3. Replace the placeholder links (`your-deployed-site-link.com`, `your-presentation-link.com`) with your actual site URL and presentation link.

👉 Do you want me to also show you **how to take nice screenshots** (with browser tools or online generators) so they look professional in your README?
